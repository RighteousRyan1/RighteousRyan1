Hello, I'm RighteousRyan, but you can call me Ryan. I'm currently a university freshman, and currently working on my own video game that's expecting completion sometime this year (2024).

Things I am interested in are video games (competitive, adventure, strategic), game development, video editing, software development and the future, engineering, and most importantly- cars. In a workspace environment, the languages I like to use are C# and C++. The languages I don't like to use but can use are Lua, Python, Java, and Haxe. I'm currently still learning the nooks and crannies of C++, Java, and Lua. I enjoy dabbling in reverse engineering from time to time, especially with games from the Wii. I am using C# to develop my game with the OpenGL rendering library. I use other languages on the side, but I've done nothing of note with them in which I would put them on a GitHub repository.

I'm open to collaborate on projects I might find myself being passionate about, such as game mods, software applications, APIs, and potentially in the future, video games, but I want to first finish my own.

You can reach me through:
  - My work gmail (ryanrotunno59@gmail.com)
  - Discord (RighteousRyan#8008)
  - LinkedIn (Coming Soon)

If you want to see my YouTube channel, [here](https://youtube.com/c/RighteousRyan) it is.

During high school is when I'll be the most open, so if you need something, time is running out!
